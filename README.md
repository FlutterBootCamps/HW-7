# HW-7

## Overview
We were tasked with making a simple application, that shows a bunch of pictures and waits 10 seconds between each picture.

<br>
<br>

## Main Page
Here the application will start with a logo saying best friends, then start showing the pictures one by one, while also playing music in the background.

### P.S
  - When running the program for the first time, you'll be asked to enable Multidex, please do so that the application works.
